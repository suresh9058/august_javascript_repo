Difference var, let and const
loops 


while, for 
Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times.
// initialization, condition, increment/decrement

Objects for..in loop
Array for..of loop

Difference var, let and const
1. hoisting 
2. scope/memory
3. redeclare/update

Hoisting means it is a mechanism where it moves the variable declarations & function declarations to the top of its nearest scope

var supports hoisting
var is old school
var a=10;

let, const doesn't hositing

let and const
let it can be modified

let a=10;
a =12;

const ORG_NAME = "TCS";
const arr = [1,2,3,4]; //#abcdef121231

2. scope/memory
	var is function level scope
	let/const block level scope

3. redeclare/ update

var supports redeclare/ and updating
let support updating not redeclaration
const no redeclare/ no update
